# A 3x3 matrix can be represented by a list of nested lists: an outer list that contains three sub-lists that each contain three elements. For example, the 3x3 matrix shown below:

# Copy Code
# 1  5  8
# 4  7  2
# 3  9  6
# is represented by the following list of lists:

# Copy Code
# matrix = [
#     [1, 5, 8],
#     [4, 7, 2],
#     [3, 9, 6],
# ]
# A list of lists is sometimes called a nested list since each inner sub-list is nested inside an outer list. It also may be called a two-dimensional list.

# To access an element in the matrix, you can use bracket notation twice (such as matrix[row][col]), and include both the row index and column index within the brackets. Given the above matrix, matrix[0][2] is 8, and matrix[2][1] is 9. An entire row in the matrix can be referenced using a single index: matrix[1] is the row (sub-list) [4, 7, 2]. Unfortunately, a convenient notation for accessing an entire column does not exist.
# The transpose of a 3x3 matrix is the matrix that results from exchanging the rows and columns of the original matrix. For example, the transposition of the matrix shown above is:

# Copy Code
# 1  4  3
# 5  7  9
# 8  2  6
# Write a function that takes a list of lists that represents a 3x3 matrix and returns the transpose of the matrix. You should implement the function on your own, without using any external libraries.

# Take care not to modify the original matrix -- your function must produce a new matrix and leave the input matrix list unchanged.
