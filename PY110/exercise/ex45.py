# Write a function that takes a string as an argument and returns a list that contains every word from the string, with each word followed by a space and the word's length. If the argument is an empty string or if no argument is passed, the function should return an empty list.

# You may assume that every pair of words in the string will be separated by a single space.

# ExamplesCopy Code
# All of these examples should print True
