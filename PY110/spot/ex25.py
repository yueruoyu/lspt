# Pete is baking cakes and needs help calculating how many he can make with his recipes and available ingredients.
# Write a function cakes() that takes two dictionaries: the recipe and the available ingredients. Return the maximum number of cakes Pete can bake.

# Rules:
# - Ingredients not present in the objects can be considered as 0.
