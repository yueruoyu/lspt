# Some numbers have funny properties. For example:
# 89 --> 8¹ + 9² = 89 * 1
# 695 --> 6² + 9³ + 5⁴= 1390 = 695 * 2
# 46288 --> 4³ + 6⁴+ 2⁵ + 8⁶ + 8⁷ = 2360688 = 46288 * 51
# Given a positive integer n written as abcd... (a, b, c, d... being digits)
# and a positive integer p we want to find a positive integer k, if it exists,
# such as the sum of the digits of n taken to the successive powers of p is
# equal to k * n.
# In other words:
# Is there an integer k such as : (a ^ p + b ^ (p+1) + c ^(p+2) + d ^ (p+3) + ...)
# = n * k
# If it is the case we will return k, if not return -1.
# Note: n and p will always be given as strictly positive integers.
